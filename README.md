# AUDIT AGENT

## What it will do

1. **Rip evidence automatically**  
   • AWS, Okta, Jira—whatever. Point it at a role/API key and it yanks configs, logs, tickets, dumps them in S3, and fingerprints each file so nobody can claim we doctored anything later.  

2. **Draft the paperwork**  
   • LLM under the hood spits out control walkthroughs, test scripts, and those glorious *management representations* nobody wants to write. Every paragraph links back to the raw artifact it came from.  

3. **Test controls on a loop**  
   • Agents compare yesterday’s IAM diff, flag weird perms, and mark the control pass/fail without a human clicking around.  

4. **Keep an audit‑trail that survives a subpoena**  
   • SHA‑256 on every blob, rows in Postgres, immutable ledger in case the regulators ask awkward questions next year.  

5. **Play nice with the Big 4**  
   • Export work‑papers in whatever format your auditor’s portal insists on—KPMG Clara, EY Canvas, you name it.

## Why bother

Audits aren’t going away and the frameworks only multiply. Either we keep burning hundreds of hours poking through consoles, or we automate the grind and spend time on actual security work. I’m betting on automation.

Feedback welcome.
